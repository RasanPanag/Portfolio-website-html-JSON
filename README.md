## General Concept
Created my own portfolio website. This website contains all information about my education, work, contact and hobbies. To create this website I have utilized concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JSON. HTML is used to describe the structure of webpage. All the headings, text, tables, lists etc. are published using HTML. The CSS is used for styles on the webpage. All the looks and formatting are written in this CSS markup language. JavaScript is used to create animated images, dynamic behaviour on the webpage adn special effects. Jquery from JavaScript library is also used to create a code in more concise manner. JSON is used for serializing and transmitting structured data over network connection.

## Features Used:
- **HTML**:
  - **Style**: The HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
  - **head**: The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
  - **body**: he <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. Note: There can only be one <body> element in an HTML document.
  - **div**:  The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).
  - **header**: The <header> tag in HTML is used to define the header for a document or a section as it contains the information related to the title and heading of the related content.
  - **p**: The <p> HTML element represents a paragraph.
  - **section**: a section is a semantic element for creating standalone sections in a web page. These sections should be made up of related content, like contact information. The section element should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent the related content.
  - **a**: The Anchor element. The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.
  - **b**: used to bold the letters.
  - **i**: used for italic letters.
  - **script**: The <script> HTML element is used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. The <script> element can also be used with other languages, such as WebGL's GLSL shader programming language and JSON
  - **meta**: The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings
  - **tittle**: The <title> HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.
  - **link rel**: The rel attribute defines the relationship between a linked resource and the current document.

- **CSS**:
  - **width**: The width CSS property sets an element's width. By default, it sets the width of the content area, but if box-sizing is set to border-box , it sets the width of the border area
  - **paddding**: An element's padding area is the space between its content and its border. Note: Padding creates extra space within an element. In contrast, margin creates extra space around an element.
  - **background**: The background property in CSS allows you to control the background of any element (what paints underneath the content in that element). It is a shorthand property, which means that it allows you to write what would be multiple CSS properties in one.
  - **height**: The height CSS property specifies the height of an element.
  - **top**: The top CSS property participates in specifying the vertical position of a positioned element. It has no effect on non-positioned elements.
  - **z- index**: The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.
  - **visibility**: The visibility CSS property shows or hides an element without changing the layout of a document.
  - **opacity**: The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.
  - **-webkit-transition**: The -webkit-transition Boolean non-standardCSS media feature is a WebKit extension whose value is true if the browsing context supports CSS transitions. Apple has a description in Safari CSS Reference; this is now called transition there.
  - **transform**: The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
  - **color**: The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the currentcolor value. currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color
  - **transition**: CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.
  - **margin**: a margin is the space around an element's border, while padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. Put another way, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.
  - **text-align**: The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis.
  - **Flexbox**: The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.
