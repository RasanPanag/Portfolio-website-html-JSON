                My name is Rasandeep Singh Panag (Short name: Rasan). I am a Bachelor of Computer Information systems graduate. I got my degree in April 2022 from the University of the Fraser Valley. I am working as a Customer Service Representative at Coastal pacific express where I resolve the customer’s complaints by determining the root cause and acting immediately with an appropriate plan. I update and extract data from the Database by writing SQL queries to verify concerns. I also troubleshoot automation failures from the truck’s satellite by the truck driver. For example, if the truck driver is trying to pass an Arrival update through the software on their satellite at the shipper and for some reason, his update is not passing automatically in our system then I receive an email in my inbox through which I look into our database and try to solve his/her problem. Sometimes the problem is really simple like the wrong trailer number then I just update the trip and let the driver know that he has input the wrong trailer # but sometimes it is complex for example two trucks are using the same trailer number then I have to verify with the shipper that which trailer # is this driver is using or I look into trip notes. I also, need to update the reason why this trip was late in our system notes. Apart from that I also have Teacher’s Assistants’ experience at my university where I have assisted, my favorite instructors Jerry Ang and Robert macculfie, in teaching classes like Programming, hardware, and Html. My job was to help students with labs related to object-oriented programming and web development. Implement concepts like changing passwords, changing hostname, retrieving IP addresses, and status of the connection with other devices in the labs. My job was also to assist students in building an understanding of database design concepts, and the ability to participate in short and long-term planning of database projects. I have also helped define and document infrastructure and systems configuration, and perform automated testing tasks for complex features routinely. Developed custom reporting tools, generated project reports, and alerted for builds and environments.

                                As for my character, I would like to describe myself as one with a very positive attitude, and a straightforward and easygoing person. Besides this I am confident and a smart worker. I am persistent. I mean I work hard and I don’t give up quickly, strong willpower. I am very adventurous by nature; I like to take on new challenges. It gives me inspiration and good experiences in my life. I am a good time manager and task organizer. The pressure of doing more work gives me the motivation to perform even better.</p>

                      i.e. Data abstraction

                      There are two arrays used to store ATM # and pin #. Without the correct ATM number and PIN, the code
                      will not be executed completely

                    <p>This project will show you how we can enter into a deadlock while running a program on a terminal and it will
                      also show how we can bypass the deadlock. There are two <b>C programming</b> files one file is based on the scenario that there are five cricket teams numbered zero to four and there are 4 sets of three wickets.
Each team needs two sets to practice for their upcoming matches but, on the ground, each team
has one set to use. So, for them, to practice they must share a set of wickets.
The set on their right-hand side has the same number as the team. So, each team will reach its own set.
When they have their assigned set of wickets. Then the team will reach wickets that are assigned to their neighbor.
After one team has both sets of wickets then they will practice. After practice then that team
can return the set of wickets to their original position on the ground. The process is repeated until there is
no more team left to practice. White the other file is based on the same scenario but, it has four teams that will attempt to
practice at the same time. The new implementation uses the semaphore "num_can_practice" to limit the number of teams who can practice at the same time. This semaphore is initialized to four, one less than the number of philosophers.
Also, this file is created to solve the problem of actual or potential deadlocks.</p>

Next, the second user will place their sign in the remaining boxes
The game will end in winning if one of the players has placed their respective signs three consecutive times in a straight line row-wise, column-wise, or diagonally. Or Else, it is a draw, if all boxes are filled.
